## My process

  I started this challenge considering the mockup data provided in the started package. By doing so, I needed to add types to the provided JSON. After that, I structured the page. First I finished the search and the filter method. Then I work on the rendering the flags in a mobile device. Once I completed this task, I work on the feature to toggle between dark-mode and light-mode. Once I finished that, I added the react-router-dom and work on the detailed page.
